#User guide for FsEye

= Installation =

  * Download and unzip featured release of FsEye from the [http://code.google.com/p/fseye/downloads/list Downloads] page
  * Load FsEye.fsx within an FSI session, e.g. {{{#load @"C:\FsEye\FsEye.fsx"}}}. This will automatically bring {{{eye}}} into scope for programmatically manipulating FsEye as well as attaching a listener to the FSI session to automatically add and update FsEye watches.
  * Open Swensen.FsEye within .fs files in order to gain intellisense to the open {{{eye}}} instance.
