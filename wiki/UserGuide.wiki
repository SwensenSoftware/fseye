= Installation =

  * Download and unzip featured release of FsEye from the [http://code.google.com/p/fseye/downloads/list Downloads] page
  * Load FsEye.fsx within an FSI session, e.g. {{{#load @"C:\FsEye\FsEye.fsx"}}}. This will automatically bring {{{eye}}} into scope for programmatically manipulating FsEye as well as attaching a listener to the FSI session to automatically add and update FsEye watches.
  * Open Swensen.FsEye within .fs files in order to gain intellisense to the open {{{eye}}} instance.

== Adding and updating watches ==

Adding and updating watches is done one of two ways:
  # Send let bindings (or unnamed "it" bindings) to the F# Interactive, FsEye will automatically add, or update an existing, watch in the GUI tree view.
  # Programmatically add, or update an existing, watch using {{{eye.Watch}}}, e.g. {{{eye.Watch("watchName", watchValue)}}}

An existing root watch may also be refreshed (for example, if it's value has been mutated) via the GUI tree right-click context menu -> Refresh
