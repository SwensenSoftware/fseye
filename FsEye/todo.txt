TODO 

Issue 25, Plugin Architecture: 
* DONE Decouple TabContainer from PluginManager
* DONE Create PluginTabContainer control
* Add optional ValueInfo property to Watch to include Value, Type, and Text
* Add ExpressionInfo property to Watch to include Expression (e.g. [0], GetBla(), PropHere),
  optional InterfaceName, IsNonPublic (or maybe IsPublic to avoid the double negative).
* Refactor PluginManager: not happy yet, look for appropriate design patterns (i.e. we have the
  PluginManager, ManagedPlugins, and ManagedWatchViewers that are tightly couple but we want to
  limit mutable surface)
* Consider whether we want IPlugin.IsWatchable to be Type -> bool or obj -> Type -> bool (where obj is
  the actual obj instance of the watch candidate.

Issue 26, PropertyGrid:
* Consider SelectedObjects vs. SelectedObject. Maybe save for future enhancement.
